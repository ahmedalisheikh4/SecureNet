# 🔒 SecureNet: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Implementation

## 📌 Project Overview
**SecureNet** is a **network security project** that focuses on designing and implementing an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The IDS continuously monitors network traffic, detects suspicious activities, and alerts network administrators to potential security breaches.  

This project demonstrates the importance of **network security** and **threat detection** in modern computer networks.

## 📋 Project Description
### **Key Features of SecureNet IDS**
✔ **Network Traffic Monitoring** - Detect abnormal behavior and security breaches.  
✔ **Signature-Based Detection** - Identify known threats like malware & DDoS attacks.  
✔ **Anomaly-Based Detection** - Detect deviations from normal traffic patterns.  
✔ **Alerting System** - Notify administrators about security incidents.  
✔ **Cisco Device Integration** - Simulated deployment within a **Cisco-based network**.

## 🏗️ Network Topology
The **network infrastructure** in Cisco Packet Tracer consists of:
- **Client Devices** (Computers, Laptops, Mobile Phones)
- **Cisco Routers & Switches** (Handling Network Traffic)
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
- **Web & Application Servers**
- **IP Phones & CCTV Monitoring System**

---

## 🖥️ Network Scenarios Implemented
### **1️⃣ Send Packet Between Two Floors**
- A packet is sent from a **1st-floor computer** to a **5th-floor computer**.
- The step-by-step routing through switches, core switches, and access points is tracked.

### **2️⃣ Command Line Interface (CLI) Scenario**
- Devices send **ping requests** to verify network connectivity.

### **3️⃣ Website Scenario**
- Users access a **simulated website** within the network using **DNS resolution**.

### **4️⃣ IP-Phone Scenario**
- Establishes a telephone call between **two IP phones** on different floors.

### **5️⃣ CCTV Scenario**
- Connects **security cameras** to the network to enable remote monitoring.
